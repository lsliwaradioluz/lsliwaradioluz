### Hi / Cze≈õƒá / Salut / Hallo / Ciao ! üëã

My name is ≈Åukasz and my goal is to become a proficient Javascript developer. I'm aiming at proficiency in Node.js and Vue.js although I've been toying with React too.

Udemy courses I've taken (in chronological order): 
* The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert! ‚úîÔ∏è
* Vue - The Complete Guide (w/ Router, Vuex, Composition API) ‚úîÔ∏è
* CSS - The Complete Guide 2020 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass) ‚úîÔ∏è
* Nuxt.js - Vue.js on Steroids ‚úîÔ∏è
* JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced) ‚úîÔ∏è
* NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno) ‚úîÔ∏è
* React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) ‚úîÔ∏è

Taking at the moment:
* React Testing with Jest and Enzyme (that is a hard one) ‚ùå 

I'm also familiar with:
* https://javascript.info/ -> going back to it quite often, especialy to refresh my knowledge on concepts like prototypes, classes, recursion and currying. I don't use them very often in my code and keep forgetting ‚úîÔ∏è

Other skills: 
* CAE Cambridge English Certificate (C1)
* Radio / TV / Newspaper journalism experience (solid writing)
* Fitness and personal training experience (good with people)
